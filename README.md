# cips

This is the official repository for the Cartesi Improvement Proposal (CIP) governance system.

Cartesi Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Cartesi platform.

Before you initiate a pull request, please read the CIP-1 process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request in a GitHub issue in this repository.

There can discussion about a CIP elsewhere, but a master Github issue must be opened in this repository to represent the entire discussion on the CIP. The master issue can then link to other issues or other threds in other forums.
